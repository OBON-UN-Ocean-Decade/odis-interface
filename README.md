# About this repository

This repository contains both guidance and mechanisms to connect the digital holdings of the [Ocean Biomolecular Observing Network (OBON)]([url](https://www.obon-ocean.org/#goals)) partnership to the IOC-UNESCO [IODE](https://www.iode.org/) Ocean Data and Information System (ODIS).

# The approach

## Aim

In line with the UN Ocean Decade's [Data and Information Strategy](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000385542.locale=en) and emerging guidance from its Data Strategy Implementation Group (DSIG), OBON seeks to connect the (meta)data, information, and knowledge generated by its partners to the Decade's digital commons.


## In a nutshell: Phase 0

Deep interoperability across OBON partners and the broader ocean community via (meta)data exchange.

To meet our aim, we align to and leverage the [FAIR Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) as implemented by the [Ocean Data and Information System (ODIS)]([url](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/)https://book.oceaninfohub.org/), a broad federation of partners coordinated by the [International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE)](https://www.iode.org/) of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO.

ODIS connects a diverse range of independent data systems ("nodes" in the ODIS network) using Linked Open Data (LOD) and data-on-the-web principles. Each ODIS partner shares a small metadata file that lets other partners know what kind of data it has, where it is, how it was generated, and why it was created.

Many OBON partners already archive their data with organisations tha are ODIS nodes (e.g. the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), Research Data Australia), but we still must verify that these nodes are relaying biomolecular data to the broader commons in a meaningful and complete way. 

In this Organisation's repos, we'll have to streamline and consolidate a machine-actionable overview of the OBON's partnership's digital assets, and build our own digital startegy and collective implementation norms and culture.

## Two primary workflows

### Leverage existing links

Many OBON partners are already submitting their (meta)data to an existing ODIS node. The list of nodes is updated live, here: http://dashboard.oceaninfohub.org/ 

If this is the case, the task is to ensure that those links/nodes are relaying (meta)data in the form we're happy with. If not, we can call for updates centrally, to benefit and align all partners in a coordinated fashion.

Some recommendations for (meta)data exchange are already in play:
* Experts/People - register in OceanExpert: https://oceanexpert.org/
* Projects -  register in OceanExpert: https://oceanexpert.org/
* Data sources - register in ODISCat: https://catalogue.odis.org/
* Methods - upload to either 1) [BeBOP](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON) or 2) the Ocean Best Practices System (https://oceanbestpractices.org/)


### Create your own link

If an OBON Partner wishes to create their own link to ODIS (e.g. for greater control over their digital presence), they can follow the implementation guidance [here](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/publishing/publishing.html), and/or [contact the ODIS/OIH team](https://oceaninfohub.org/contact-2/)

# Challenges and future work

To secure its digital legacy, and lead the transformation of ocean biomolecular 

## Trusted long-term archives

A core requirement for safeguarding biomolecular is that they are archived in a trusted, long-term repository. Many of these have aligned themselves to the [TRUST Principles]([url](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0486-7)), 
OBON must take stock of where its partners archive their data, and whether those archives are interoperable with the Decade systems.

## Phase 1 - deeper interoperation

As the metadata exchange layer in Phase 0 matures, we'll also need to focus on deeper interoperabiliy: when the metadata leads an OBON partner to another's dataset, is that dataset "ready to go" for analysis and integration?

## Common (meta)data formats and specifications

We sub-specifications for:
* Mock communities / metrology standards
* Inter-calibration data sets
* and many more - issues to be generated in an OBON Project

Delivery formats to global processes
* GOOS EOVs (xref MARCO-BOLO)
* SDG-associated data
* Regional/national indicators (e.g. MFSD, WFD)
* and many more - issues to be generated in an OBON Project

## Licenses, embargoes, restrictions

This topic requires some careful discussion and development, particularly in light of Nagoya.

# Updates

This approach is subject to change. Our update process needs some light formalisation to keep things smooth. The OBON Data Committee will address this when convened.
