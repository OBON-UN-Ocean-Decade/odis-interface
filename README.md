# About this repository

This repository contains both guidance and mechanisms to connect the digital holdings of the [Ocean Biomolecular Observing Network (OBON)]([url](https://www.obon-ocean.org/#goals)) partnership to the IOC-UNESCO [IODE](https://www.iode.org/) Ocean Data and Information System (ODIS).

# The approach

## Aim

In line with the UN Ocean Decade's [Data and Information Strategy](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000385542.locale=en) and emerging guidance from its Data Strategy Implementation Group (DSIG), OBON seeks to connect the (meta)data, information, and knowledge generated by its partners to the Decade's digital commons.



## In a nutshell: Phase 1

Deep interoperability across OBON partners and the broader ocean community 

To meet our aim, we align to and leverage the [FAIR Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) as implemented by the [Ocean Data and Information System (ODIS)]([url](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/)https://book.oceaninfohub.org/), a broad federation of partners coordinated by the [International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE)](https://www.iode.org/) of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO.

ODIS connects a diverse range of independent data systems ("nodes" in the ODIS network) using Linked Open Data (LOD) and data-on-the-web principles. Each ODIS partner shares a small metadata file that lets other partners know what kind of data it has, where it is, 

Many OBON partners already archive their data with organisations tha are ODIS nodes (e.g. the Ocean Biodiversity Information System

In this Organisation's repos, we'll have to streamline and consolidate a machine-actionable overview of the OBON's partnership's digital assets. 

## Two primary workflows

### Leverage existing links

Many OBON partners are already submitting their (meta)data to an existing ODIS node. The list of nodes is updated live, here: http://dashboard.oceaninfohub.org/ 

Some examples of existing nodes
* OBIS
* Research Data Australia 
* OceanExpert
* ODISCat
* BeBOP
* INVEMAR
* ZMT
* CIOOS

### Create your own link



# Challenges and future work

To secure its digital legacy, and lead the transformation of ocean biomolecular 

## Trusted long-term archives

A core requirement for safeguarding biomolecular is that they are archived in a trusted, long-term repository. Many of these have aligned themselves to the [TRUST Principles]([url](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0486-7)), 

## Common (meta)data formats and specifications

Need sub-specifications for:
* Mock communities / metrology standards
* Inter-calibration data sets
* 

Delivery formats to global processes
* GOOS EOVs (xref MARCO-BOLO)
* SDG-associated data
* Regional/national indicators (e.g. MFSD, WFD)

## Licenses, embargoes, restrictions
